IF contains technical specifications \u2192 Add \"Technical Documentation\"\n   \n   e. IF contains contract/proposal information \u2192 Add \"Contractual\"\n\n3. **Government Content Priority Rule**:\n   - ANY .gov domain reference (email or URL) \u2192 PRIMARY classification MUST be at least \"Confidential\"\n   - Even if content seems public, .gov association requires \"Confidential\" + \"Government Content\" tag\n   - Exception: If document is published press release citing .gov source, may remain \"Public\" but still add \"Government Content\" tag\n\n**Context-Aware Examples**:\n- \"F-35 radar schematic serial ABC-123\" \u2192 Primary: \"Highly Sensitive\", Tags: [\"Defense Related\", \"Technical Documentation\"]\n- \"Our proposal for F-35 maintenance\" \u2192 Primary: \"Confidential\", Tags: [\"Defense Related\", \"Contractual\", \"Business Sensitive\"]\n- \"Email from official@dhs.gov regarding policy\" \u2192 Primary: \"Confidential\", Tags: [\"Government Content\"]\n- \"Internal memo citing EPA.gov regulations\" \u2192 Primary: \"Confidential\", Tags: [\"Government Content\", \"Business Sensitive\"]\n- \"News: F-35 program milestone\" \u2192 Primary: \"Public\", Tags: []\n- \"Press release mentioning whitehouse.gov statement\" \u2192 Primary: \"Public\", Tags: [\"Government Content\"]\n\n**Conservative Approach**:\n- When relevance scores are borderline (0.3-0.6), use document context to decide primary classification\n- When unsure, classify UP to higher sensitivity level for primary\n- Apply ALL relevant additional labels\n- .gov detection ALWAYS triggers at least \"Confidential\" primary + \"Government Content\" tag\n\n**Required Output Format**:\n{\n  \"classification\": \"[Public|Confidential|Highly Sensitive|Unsafe]\",\n  \"additional_labels\": [\"Array of strings: Government Content, Defense Related, Business Sensitive, Technical Documentation, Contractual, etc.\"],\n  \"government_content_detected\": [true/false],\n  \"gov_references\": [\"List of .gov domains or government entities found\"],\n  \"confidence\": [0.0-1.0],\n  \"summary\": \"[Brief 2-3 sentence summary of document]\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"[Detailed explanation of why this classification and labels were chosen]\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"page\": [page number or null],\n      \"region\": \"[description of location]\",\n      \"quote\": \"[relevant quote or description]\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"[why this supports the classification]\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"safety_assessment\": {\n    \"is_safe\": [true/false],\n    \"flags\": [\"MUST BE ONE OR MORE OF: Safe, Child Safety Violation, Hate Speech, Violence, Exploitative Content, Criminal Activity, Political News, Cyber Threat, Threats, Harassment, Profanity\"],\n    \"details\": \"[explanation]\",\n    \"confidence\": [0.0-1.0]\n  }\n}\n\n**CRITICAL**: \n- Provide AT LEAST 2-3 pieces of evidence with specific page citations\n- Be conservative: when in doubt, classify higher sensitivity for primary\n- Apply ALL relevant additional labels\n- Confidence < 0.7 should trigger human review\n- Safety violations ALWAYS result in 'Unsafe' primary classification\n- .gov detection ALWAYS adds \"Government Content\" tag and upgrades to at least \"Confidential\"\n- Safety flags MUST use EXACT values listed above (case-sensitive)"
